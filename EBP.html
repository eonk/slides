#&lt;p style="color:grey"&gt;Evidence-based poincing in action&lt;/p&gt;
###Case 1: Targeted policing in high-crime areas reduces youth violence
####&lt;p style="color:purple"&gt;Evidence&lt;/p&gt; 
The Youth Endowment Fund (YEF) revealed that hot spots policing on average reduces violent crime by 14 per cent and overall offending by 17 per cent. It said the findings are backed by the results from recent police trials, with one force seeing violent crime drop by as much as 74 per cent.

####&lt;p style="color:purple"&gt;Policing recommendation&lt;/p&gt; 
The dedicated teams including Operation Reacher, burglary, knife crime, robbery and neighbourhood policing teams are now out and about every day in hot-spot locations across Nottinghamshire protecting the public and preventing crime as well as relentlessly pursuing offenders who break the law.

#&lt;p style="color:grey"&gt;Evidence-based poincing in action&lt;/p&gt;
###Case 2: The use of evidence-based policing platform
####&lt;p style="color:purple"&gt;Evidence&lt;/p&gt; 
The Delaware State Police (DSP) uses a SAS-powered analytics platform that aggregates and analyzes data from multiple sources such as organizational data, traffic citations, criminal incidents and statewide calls for law enforcement service. It looks at the data to understand the nature of the crime, determine how police can devise appropriate responses and then measure the impact of those responses.

####&lt;p style="color:purple"&gt;Policing recommendation&lt;/p&gt;
In the past, the range of officers may be using five or six different tools to do their job. Now, DSP has a centralized infrastructure that gives the public safety community shared records management and computer-aided dispatch capabilities.

#&lt;p style="color:grey"&gt;Evidence-based poincing in action&lt;/p&gt;
###Case 3: Repeat offenders and crime variations
####&lt;p style="color:purple"&gt;Evidence&lt;/p&gt; 
Crime risks vary consistently and are typically concentrated by the time of day, the day of the week, season, type of holiday and even weather conditions. Additionally, only a few offenders commit most of the crime. Some estimates show that just 3-5 percent of the population commit 50-60 percent of crime. Additionally, based on the ‚Äúpower few‚Äù or loosely connected 20/80 rule, 80 percent of all crime might be committed by 20 percent of the population.

####&lt;p style="color:purple"&gt;Policing recommendation&lt;/p&gt; 
With the assistance of a crime analyst, track repeat offenders for repeat offenses and monitor when they are in and out of jail. Staff your patrol teams when crime is the highest. Also, after assessing the data, use crime reduction teams to target hot places, hot people and hot times. Avoid random patrol and consider a focused offender approach ‚Äì partner with probation, parole and prosecution.

---
#&lt;p style="color:grey"&gt;Evidence-based poincing in action&lt;/p&gt;
###Case 4: Hot spot policing
####&lt;p style="color:purple"&gt;Evidence&lt;/p&gt; 
If police assessed the data and patrolled hot places sporadically and unpredictably every two hours for 10-16 minutes they could have a measurable impact on crime with a policing strategy known as the ‚ÄúKoper Curve.‚Äù. In Sacramento, a hot spot study was conducted involving an intervention area (the hot spot patrols), which was then compared to a control area or (business was usual). The result fount crime incidents decreased 25 percent in the intervention (treatment) hot spots compared to the business as usual (control) hot spots (where crime incidents rose 27 percent).

####&lt;p style="color:purple"&gt;Policing recommendation&lt;/p&gt; 
If police leaders can place an officer in that hot spot for 15 minutes unpredictably and sporadically, then research shows a decrease in crime that lasts for 2 hours. Suddenly, this becomes much more realistic and manageable.

#&lt;p style="color:grey"&gt;Evidence-based poincing in action&lt;/p&gt;
###Case 5: Burglary risks
####&lt;p style="color:purple"&gt;Evidence&lt;/p&gt; 
Predictable risk of residential burglary occurs in the areas to the side, front and behind the victim‚Äôs residence for the first 10-14 days after the crime. This evidence has been ignored for years and was just recently tested in Redlands, California, and Baltimore City, Maryland.

####&lt;p style="color:purple"&gt;Policing recommendation&lt;/p&gt; 
After a burglary warn neighbors of their risk and suggest ways in which they can target harden their residence such as locking back windows; utilizing ring technology, video surveillance, alarms and motion lights; cutting away shrubbery; and encouraging more guardianship of neighbors.

#&lt;p style="color:grey"&gt;Evidence-based poincing in action&lt;/p&gt;
###Case 6: Domestic homicide predictors
####&lt;p style="color:purple"&gt;Evidence&lt;/p&gt; 
Thames Valley Police (UK) records were examined for 118 victims and 120 offenders in 118 cases of ‚Äúdeadly‚Äù domestic violence: murder, attempted murder, manslaughter and grievous bodily harm. The case-control study found male offenders who committed serious domestic assaults were over three times more likely than other violent offenders to have had markers of suicidal tendencies

####&lt;p style="color:purple"&gt;Policing recommendation&lt;/p&gt; 
Use this information as a threat matrix and tailor services accordingly. If there are those suicidal tendencies, utilize support services and other partners for prevention.
---
#&lt;p style="color:grey"&gt;Evidence-based poincing in action&lt;/p&gt;
###Case 7: Cognitive interviewing techniques
####&lt;p style="color:purple"&gt;Evidence&lt;/p&gt; 
According to several studies, cognitive interviewing techniques, or asking open-ended questions, reinstating the context by eliciting memory retrieval cues, and focusing on sensory details ‚Äì resulted in 25-40 percent more details. Many U.S. local police do not practice cognitive interviewing techniques when speaking to victims and witnesses of violent crime, despite significant evidence that shows the victim will feel heard, empowered, and less often felt re-victimized.
####&lt;p style="color:purple"&gt;Policing recommendation&lt;/p&gt; 
Show empathy ‚Äì acknowledge trauma and pain, use open-ended questions, i.e., ‚Äútell me more‚Äù and ‚Äúhelp me understand.‚Äù Use powerful retrieval cues like smell and sound. Ask impact questions ‚Äì ‚ÄúHow has this impacted you? What can‚Äôt you forget about the experience?‚Äù

#&lt;p style="color:grey"&gt;Bridge the divide between &lt;br /&gt; academic research and police practice&lt;/p&gt;

###1. Transferring scientific knowledge to the practice community
"Unfortunately, EBP remains a foreign concept to millions of police officers and leaders around the world (Sherman, 2015). While higher-ranking officers exhibit more knowledge of EBP than lower-ranking officers, they tend to define it in a way that is different from the intended meaning (Telep &amp; Bottema, 2020)...

[the knowlege tranfer] could be further assisted by involving police practitioners directly in the interpretation of findings and discussion of their implications for policy and practice...the development and delivery of an EBP training program for mid-level command staff..."

#&lt;p style="color:grey"&gt;Bridge the divide between &lt;br /&gt; academic research and police practice&lt;/p&gt;

###2. Empow- ering officers to conduct police-led science
"There are a number of inherent limitations in such an approach, including the typically slow-moving process of research not fitting an expedited timeline needed to inform policy and practice, and academic researchers lacking the skill to help with specific problems facing practitioners. For such reasons, Sherman (2011) proposes a move towards a model of police-led science, which puts police officers at the fore- front of generating evidence, with agencies empowering their officers to develop and test research questions."

#&lt;p style="color:grey"&gt;Bridge the divide between &lt;br /&gt; academic research and police practice&lt;/p&gt;

###3. Aligning the work of researchers and practitioners
"Researcher-practitioner partnerships can provide an environment that fosters evidence-based policing, especially when both parties contribute to problem identification, strategy development, and strategy implementation (Mock, 2010). A partnership environment helps both sides to navigate the competing interests and incentive structures of academia and policing."

#&lt;p style="color:grey"&gt;Bridge the divide between &lt;br /&gt; academic research and police practice&lt;/p&gt;

###4. Incorporating evidence-based policing in daily police functions
"A wide range of innovative approaches have been carried out in recent years as part of a growing effort to embed evidence-based policing principles in daily police functions; the Evidence-Based Policing Matrix (Lum et al., 2010), CompStat360 platform etc.

...The New Zealand Police Service‚Äôs Evidence-Based Policing Centre (EBPC) is structured around four key functions: (a) data science; (b) performance, research, and insights; (c) delivery and improve- ments; and (d) implementation and evaluation.

...Two main perspectives guide [the Cambridge Police Executive Programme (CPEP)]‚Äôs approach to EBP: (a) EBP should serve as a ‚Äúgeneral framework for making decisions‚Äù and (b) EBP is a ‚Äústrategy for organizing police activities around a holistic mission of reducing total harm from crimes‚Äù (Sherman, 2022: 301)."

####"Evidence-based practice it is not solely focused on being dependent on peer-reviewed research. Experience plays a vital role in evidence-based practice, only it‚Äôs not any old experience that counts here. There is experience and ***experience***. Understanding the role of experience in evidence based practice, and what types of experience that is matters."(Wilkinson, 2006)
